## KNOW YOUR PEPES

A memory based card game that uses pepe gifs as cards. The game will track the time it takes for a user to match all the cards. The top 5 times will be shown on the highscores table.

## Motivation

I love the pepe meme and thought it would be a fun idea to incorporate it into a card game.

## Tech/framework used

Ex. - JavaScript, DOM, HTML/CSS, LocalStorage, Flexbox

Javascript => used to make the game functional

DOM => Manipulating certain parts of the screen when pressing on buttons

HTML/CSS => The layout and colors of the entire website

LocalStorage => store highscores and name locally

Flexbox => make the website responsive

<b>Built with</b>

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Features

It's PEPE themed and has great music!

## Installation

Enter this link onto your URL https://iouie.github.io/Know-Your-Pepe

## How to use?

Click the play button, enter your name and pick 2 cards to see if they match. If you want, you can check the highscores!

## Stretch Goals

Instead of using localstorage to store name and timer, I want to use a server so I can see everybodies scores.
I also want to add more levels onto my game.
I also want to add little pepe twitch emotes that bounces off your web screen.
